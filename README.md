Homework description

Python has two built-in sorting functions: sorted and sort. The Python's sorted functions use Timsort, a hybrid sorting algorithm, which combines merge and insertion sorting.

Compare the three sorting algorithms: merge, insertion, and Timsort in terms of execution time. The analysis should be supported by empirical data obtained by testing the algorithms on different data sets. Empirically verify theoretical estimates of algorithm complexity, for example, by sorting on large arrays. Use the timeit module to measure the execution time of the algorithms.

Show that the combination of merge and insertion sorting makes the Timsort algorithm much more efficient and that this is the reason why programmers, in most cases, use the built-in Python algorithms rather than code them themselves. Conclude.
